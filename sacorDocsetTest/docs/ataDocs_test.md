# ATA SIEM log reference

ATA can forward suspicious activity and monitoring alert events to your SIEM. Suspicious activity events are in the CEF format. This reference article provides samples of the suspicious activity logs sent to your SIEM.

## Sample ATA suspicious activities in CEF format
The following fields and their values are forwarded to your SIEM:

-	start – the start time of the alert
-	suser – the account (usually should be user account) that is involved in this alert
-	shost – the source machine for this alert
-	outcome – for alerts that there is a success/failure of the activity performed in that alert  
-	msg – the description for the alert
-	cnt – for alerts that have a count of times that alert happened (for example brute force that has an amount of guessed passwords)
-	app – the protocol used in this alert
-	externalId – the event ID ATA writes to the event log that corresponds to this alert
-	cs#label & cs# – these are the customer strings that CEF allows to use the cs#label is the name of the new field and cs# is the value, for example:
cs1Label=url cs1=https://192.168.0.220/suspiciousActivity/5909ae198ca1ec04d05e65fa

In this example, cs1 is a field that has a URL to the alert.
